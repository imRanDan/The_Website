        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>My name is <b>Danyal</b>. I am a Software Developer from Hamilton, Ontario. My main tech stack involves Javascript related technologies.
        I enjoy building websites and web applications from scratch. Something about the process of building appeals to me. I also enjoy the 
        problem-solving aspects of it.</p>
